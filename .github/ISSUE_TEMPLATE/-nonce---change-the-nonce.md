The "nonce" card is a card with a query parameter like `https://....?nonce=123456`.

The value of this parameter is randomly generated by a workflow, which is triggered whenever someone creates an issue with the word "nonce" in the body.

Changing an arbitrary query parameter is a known technique for bypassing GitHub's image proxy service, however there is some debate about how reliable it is.

The purpose of this workflow is to validate whether that technique is still working, in order to assist users who require a non-cached version of some image asset, in order to do something that serves a good purpose.

It's not intended to be a convenient way to put unnecessary strain on GitHub's or camo's servers, nor mine, where the images are served from.

By submitting an Issue with the word "nonce" in it, you agree that you are doing it for a benign reason, and that the images that you are ultimately serving, which you require to be fresh, are pretty and/or cool.

I'm nonce in the mood for any noncense, so do nonce just show up un-annonced and expect me to nonce say anything - this is noncenegotiable.
